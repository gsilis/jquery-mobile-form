# jQuery Next Mobile Input Element

A jQuery plugin that can be initialized on `<form>` tags to `.focus()` the next visible keyboard-enabled input element when the user hits the enter/go button. This is so that when the user hits "Go" or something similar on a mobile device, the form is not submitted.

This is just a concept, no releases as of yet.
